    <h1 class="fixed"> School </h1> 
    <p> school is a place where people go to learn about topics such as reading, writing and mathematics. In a school or university, one or more teachers help students to learn.
In many places around the world, children have to go to school for a certain number of years. Learning may take place in the classroom, in outside environments or on visits to other places. Colleges and universities are places to learn for students over 17 or 18.[2] Vocational schools teach skills people need for jobs.
